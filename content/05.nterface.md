# Interface

An **interface** is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to define a structure that classes must follow, **without any implementation details**. Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in C#.

## What Is an Interface

- An **interface** specifies **what** a class must do, but **not how** it does it.
- To create an interface in C#, you must use the `interface` keyword.
- Can’t be instantiated directly, meaning you can’t create an object from an interface.
- Interfaces can’t declare fields or constructors (except the static ones).
- Methods are defined without implementation (Pre C# 8.0) 
- Any class that implements an interface **must provide concrete implementations** for all its members.
- A single class can implement **multiple interfaces** (unlike classes, which can only inherit from one base class).
- By convention, **interface names begin with an uppercase `I`** (e.g., `IShape`, `IDriveable`).

> [!TIP]
> In C# 8.0 and later, interfaces can include default implementations, but generally, they only declare members.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IDriveable
{
    void Start();
    void Stop();
}
```

## Implementing an Interface

A class implements an interface using a colon (`:`), which indicates that the class must provide implementations for all interface members. If a class fails to implement all members, it must be declared as `abstract`.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Car : IDrivable
{
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is starting...");
    }

    public void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is stopping...");
    }
}
```

## Implementing Multiple Interfaces

A class can implement **multiple interfaces** by listing them, separated by commas.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IVehicle
{
    void SpeedUp(int increment);
}
```

```csharp
public class Bicycle : IDrivable, IVehicle
{
    int speed;

    public void SpeedUp(int increment)
    {
        speed = speed + increment;
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bicycle is starting...");
    }

    public void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bicycle is stopping...");
    }
}
```

## Interface Inheritance

Interfaces can **inherit from one or more other interfaces**, allowing you to build a more complex structure.

```csharp
public interface IElectric : IDrivable, IVehicle
{
    void ChargeBattery();
}
```
Any class that implements `IElectric` must also implement all members of `IDrivable`, `IVehicle`, and `IElectric`.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class ElectricScooter : IElectric
{
    int batteryLevel = 100;
    int speed = 0;

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Electric scooter is starting...");
    }

    public void Stop()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Electric scooter is stopping...");
    }

    public void SpeedUp(int increment)
    {
        speed = speed + increment;
    }

    public void ChargeBattery()
    {
        batteryLevel = 100;
        Console.WriteLine("Battery charged.");
    }
}
```

## Explicit Interface Implementation

If a class implements multiple interfaces that have members with the same name, you can use **explicit interface implementation** to resolve naming conflicts.

**Example:**
```csharp
public interface IGasVehicle
{
    void Refuel();
}

public interface IElectricVehicle
{
    void Refuel();
}

public class HybridCar : IGasVehicle, IElectricVehicle
{
    void IGasVehicle.Refuel()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Refueling with gasoline...");
    }

    void IElectricVehicle.Refuel()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Recharging battery...");
    }
}

```
These explicitly implemented methods are only accessible through an interface reference.
```csharp
HybridCar hybrid = new HybridCar();
((IGasVehicle)hybrid).Refuel();       // Output: Refueling with gasoline...
((IElectricVehicle)hybrid).Refuel();  // Output: Recharging battery...
```

## Differences Between Abstract Classes and Interfaces

| Feature                  | Abstract Class                         | Interface                           |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Members                  | Can have fields or methods             | Only methods signatures (except default implementations in C# 8.0+)             |
| Constructors             | Can have constructors                  | Can’t have constructors (except static constructors)           |
| Multiple Inheritance     | Not supported                          | Supported                           |



## Practice
Create the following as described:

1. **Create an interface `IShape`** with:
   - A method `double GetArea();`
   - A method `double GetPerimeter();`

2. **Create a class `Circle`** that:
   - Implements `IShape`.
   - Has a constructor that takes a `radius`.
   - Implements `GetArea()` and `GetPerimeter()`.

3. **Create a class `Rectangle`** that:
   - Implements `IShape`.
   - Has a constructor that takes `width` and `height`.
   - Implements `GetArea()` and `GetPerimeter()`.

4. **Test your classes** by running the following code:
```csharp
class Program
{
     static void Main()
     {
          IShape shape = new Circle(5);
          Console.WriteLine(shape.GetArea());
          Console.WriteLine(shape.GetPerimeter());

          shape = new Rectangle(4, 6);
          Console.WriteLine(shape.GetArea());
          Console.WriteLine(shape.GetPerimeter());
     }
}
```
