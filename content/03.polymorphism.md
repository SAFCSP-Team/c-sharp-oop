# Polymorphism

### What is Polymorphism?
In programming, polymorphism means the ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. It enables a single method or property to perform different tasks or have different behaviors.



The term Polymorphism is derived from Greek words:  
- Poly = many  
- Morph = forms  


## Types of Polymorphism

Polymorphism in C# is classified into two types:

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Binding):**  
The decision of which method to call is made at compile time.

2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding):**  
The decision of which method to call is made at runtime.


### Method Overloading

Method overloading is where two or more methods in the same class share the same name but differ in:
- The number of parameters.
- The type of parameters.
- The order of parameters.

Which allows methods with the same name to perform different tasks based on the arguments passed.

```csharp
class ClassName {
    returnType MethodName(dataType1 param1) {
        // Method body
    }

    returnType MethodName(dataType1 param1, dataType2 param2) {
        // Method body
    }
}
```

#### Example
```csharp
class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int Add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        // Call the first Add method
        Console.WriteLine("Add (2 + 3): " + calc.Add(2, 3));

        // Call the overloaded Add method
        Console.WriteLine("Add (2 + 3 + 4): " + calc.Add(2, 3, 4));
    }
}
```

Output
```
Add (2 + 3): 5
Add (2 + 3 + 4): 9
```

### Method Overriding

Method Overriding is where a **derived class** provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its **base class**, using the `override` keyword in the **derived class** and the `virtual` keyword in the base class.

#### Rules for Method Overriding:
1. The method in the base class must be marked as `virtual`.
2. The method in the derived class must use the `override` keyword.
3. The method signature (name, parameters, and return type) must be the same in both the base and derived classes.

```csharp
class BaseClass {
    public virtual void MethodName() {
        // Base implementation
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    public override void MethodName() {
        // Derived implementation
    }
}
```


#### Example
```csharp
class Animal {
    public virtual void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal {
    public override void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog();

        myAnimal.Speak();  // Calls the base class method
        myDog.Speak();     // Calls the overridden method in Dog
    }
}
```

Output
```
The animal makes a sound
The dog barks
```


### Virtual Methods

A **virtual method** is a method in a base class that can be **overridden** in a derived class. It provides a way to define a default behavior in the base class, which can then be modified in the derived class.

#### Key Points:
- Virtual methods are declared using the `virtual` keyword.
- Derived classes can override the virtual method using the `override` keyword.
- If a derived class does not override the virtual method, the base class implementation is used.


```csharp
class BaseClass {
    public virtual void MethodName() {
        // Default behavior
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    public override void MethodName() {
        // Modified behavior
    }
}
```

#### Example
```csharp
class Vehicle {
    public virtual void Start() {
        Console.WriteLine("The vehicle starts");
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle {
    public override void Start() {
        Console.WriteLine("The car starts with a key");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Vehicle myVehicle = new Vehicle();
        Vehicle myCar = new Car();

        myVehicle.Start();  // Calls the base class method
        myCar.Start();      // Calls the overridden method in Car
    }
}
```

Output

```
The vehicle starts
The car starts with a key
```

## Practice
### PART 1: Override
1. Create a base class `Shape` with a virtual method `Draw()`.
 - Override the `Draw()` method in the derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` to display different messages (e.g., "Drawing a Circle" or "Drawing a Rectangle").
 - Create objects of each class and call the `Draw()` method.

### PART 2: Overload
1. Create and implement a class `MathOperations` with overloaded methods `Multiply()` to:
- Multiply two numbers.
  - Multiply three integers.
  - Multiply two floating-point numbers.
