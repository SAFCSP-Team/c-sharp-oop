# Abstraction

`Abstraction` is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to **focus on the essential features** of an object while **hiding its internal implementation details**. In C#, abstraction is implemented using the `abstract` keyword with classes and class members.

## What is Abstraction

- **Abstraction** focuses on **what** an object does, rather than **how** it does it.
- The `abstract` keyword is used to declare **abstract classes** and **abstract members**.
- It allows you to define the structure (using abstract classes) for other classes to follow without providing a complete implementation.

## Abstract Classes

- The **abstract class** is a class marked with the `abstract` keyword to provide a base definition for other classes to inherit from.
- **Can’t be instantiated** directly, meaning you can’t create an object from an abstract class.
- It is serve as **base classes** for other classes.
- It can contain:
  - **Abstract members** (no implementation, must be overridden).
  - **Concrete members / regular members** (fields, or methods with implementation).

### Declaring an Abstract Class

```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle            // Abstract class
{
    public string Brand;                // Concrete field

    public void ShowBrand()            // Concrete method
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Brand: {Brand}");
    }

    public abstract void Drive();    // Abstract method (no body)
}

```

### Inheriting from an Abstract Class

```csharp
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public override void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is driving.");
    }
}
```
- The `Car` class **must** override the abstract `Drive()` method.
- You can **call** the concrete `ShowBrand()` method as is.
  
## Abstract Method
- An **abstract method** is declared with the `abstract` keyword and **must be inside an abstract class**.
- **It has no implementation** and ends with a semicolon.
- Abstract methods **can’t be private**.
- Any class inheriting from an abstract class **must override all abstract methods**, unless it is also declared as an abstract class.

**Example:**
```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle
{
     public abstract void Drive(); // Abstract method
}
```

## Constructors in Abstract Classes
- Abstract classes **can** have constructors.
- These constructors are **called when an instance of a derived class is created**.

**Example:**
```csharp
public abstract class Vehicle
{
    public string Brand;

    public Vehicle(string brand)
    {
        Brand = brand;
    }

    public void ShowBrand()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Brand: {Brand}");
    }

    public abstract void Drive();
}



public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public Car(string brand) : base(brand) { }

    public override void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is driving.");
    }
}



public class Truck : Vehicle
{
    public Truck(string brand) : base(brand) { }

    public override void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Truck is hauling.");
    }
}



class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car car = new Car("Toyota");
        car.ShowBrand();   // Output: Brand: Toyota
        car.Drive();       // Output: Car is driving.

        Truck truck = new Truck("Volvo");
        truck.ShowBrand(); // Output: Brand: Volvo
        truck.Drive();     // Output: Truck is hauling.
    }
}
```
>[!IMPORTANT]
> When you create an object of a derived class (`Car` or `Truck`), the constructor of the abstract base class (`Vehicle`) is also called.

## Practice

Create the following classes as described:

1. **Create an abstract class `MediaPlayer`** with:
   - A `public string Brand` field.
   - A constructor that sets the `Brand`.
   - A concrete method `ShowBrand()` that prints the player’s brand.
   - Two abstract methods: `Play()` and `Stop()`.

2. **Create a derived class `AudioPlayer`** that:
   - Inherits from `MediaPlayer`.
   - Implements `Play()` to print: **"Playing audio..."**.
   - Implements `Stop()` to print: **"Stopping audio..."**.

3. **Create a derived class `VideoPlayer`** that:
   - Inherits from `MediaPlayer`.
   - Implements `Play()` to print: **"Playing video..."**.
   - Implements `Stop()` to print: **"Stopping video..."**.

4. **Test your classes** by running the following code:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MediaPlayer player = new AudioPlayer("Sony");
        player.ShowBrand(); // Output: Brand: Sony
        player.Play();      // Output: Playing audio...
        player.Stop();      // Output: Stopping audio...

        player = new VideoPlayer("VLC");
        player.ShowBrand(); // Output: Brand: VLC
        player.Play();      // Output: Playing video...
        player.Stop();      // Output: Stopping video...
    }
}
```
