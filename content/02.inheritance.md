# Inheritance
`Inheritance` is a foundational concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to create a new class (called a **derived class**) based on an existing class (called a **base class**). The derived class inherits fields and methods from the base class, which encourages code reuse and enhances maintainability.

The image above provides an overview of the inheritance concept, in which the **base class** features are inherited by the **derived classes**, along with their own additional features.


## What is a Base Class and Derived Class

### Base Class

- The **base class** (also known as a **parent** or **superclass**) is the class being inherited from.
- It defines members (fields and methods) that are inherited by the derived class.
  
**Example:**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Employee is working.");
    }
}
```

### Derived Class

- A **derived class** (also known as a **child** or **subclass**) is the class that inherits from the base class.
- It is defined by using the `:` symbol followed by the base class name after the class definition.
- It can access public and protected members from the base class and can add new members.
  
**Example:**
```csharp
public class Manager : Employee
{
    public void Manage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing the team.");
    }
}
```
Here, `Manager` is a derived class of `Employee`. It inherits the `Work()` method and can also have its own methods, like `Manage()`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inheritance represents an **"is a"** relationship (e.g., Manager ***is an*** Employee).


## Types of Inheritance

### Single Inheritance
A derived class inherits from one base class.

**Example:**
```csharp
class Employee
{
    public void Work()
    {
         Console.WriteLine("Employee is working.");
    }
}

class Manager : Employee
{
    public void Manage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing the team.");
    }
}
```

### Multilevel Inheritance
A class inherits from another derived class, forming a chain.

**Example:**
```csharp
class Person
{
    public void Introduce()
    {
         Console.WriteLine("Hello, I am a person.");
    }
}

class Employee : Person
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Employee is working.");
    }
}

class Manager : Employee
{
    public void Manage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing the team.");
    }
}
```

### Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple derived classes inherit from the same base class.

**Example:**
```csharp
class Employee
{
    public void Work()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Employee is working.");
    }
}

class Manager : Employee
{
    public void Manage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager is managing the team.");
    }
}

class Designer : Employee
{
    public void Design()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Designer is creating designs.");
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> C# does not support multi-inheritance of classes, which means a class can not inherit from more than one class at a time.


## Member Hiding (`new` Keyword)
If a derived class defines a member with the same name as in the base class, you can use `new` to **hide** the base member.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public void Report()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Employee submits a report.");
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public new void Report()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager submits a detailed report.");
    }
}
```

## The `base` Keyword
The `base` keyword is used in a derived class to:
- Access members (fields, methods, constructors) of its base class.
- Call the base class constructor from the derived class constructor.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Employee: {name}");
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public Manager(string name) : base(name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager created.");
    }
}
```

## Constructors and Inheritance
- Constructors **are not inherited**.
- The base class constructor runs before the derived class constructor.
- You can call a specific base class constructor using `: base(parameters)` in the derived class constructor.

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public Employee(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Employee: {name}");
    }
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public Manager(string name) : base(name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Manager created.");
    }
}
```

## The `sealed` Keyword
The `sealed` keyword prevents a class from being inherited. When a class is marked as `sealed`, no other class can derive from it. This is useful for security, design, or performance reasons.

**Example:**
```csharp
public sealed class Designer
{
    // Members
}

// This will cause a compile-time error:
// public class LeadDesigner : Designer { }
```

>[!NOTE]
> You can also use `sealed` on methods in an overridden method to prevent overriding.

## Access Modifiers and Inheritance

**Access modifiers** determine what is inherited and what is accessible from derived classes. They affect inheritance as follows:
Access modifiers control accessibility from derived classes and outside code:

| Modifier    |Accessible In the Class itself? | Accessible In Derived Class?|
|:-----------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| `public`    |Yes                             | Yes                        | 
| `protected` |Yes                             | Yes                        | 
| `private`   |Yes                             | No                         |
| `internal`  |Yes                             | Yes (only when both classes are in the same assembly)                       |

**Example:**
```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public string Name;          // Accessible everywhere
    protected int Salary;        // Accessible in derived classes
    private int employeeId;      // Only accessible in Employee
}

public class Manager : Employee
{
    public void Show()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name);     // OK
        Console.WriteLine(Salary);   // OK
        // Console.WriteLine(employeeId); // Error: 'employeeId' is private
    }
}
```

## Practice
Create the following classes as described:

1. **Create a base class** called `Vehicle` with:
   - A `public string Brand` field.
   - A `protected int Year` field.
   - A `private int vehicleId` field.
   - A constructor that sets all three fields.
   - A `public void ShowInfo()` method that prints the brand and year.
   - A `public void Report()` method that prints: "Vehicle report".

2. **Create a derived class** called `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` with:
   - A `public string Model` field.
   - A constructor that sets all the fields (using the base class constructor for the inherited fields).
   - A `public void ShowCar()` method that prints the brand, year, and model.
   - A `new` method `Report()` that hides the base class method and prints: "Car report".

3. **Create a sealed derived class** called `ElectricCar` that inherits from `Car` with:
   - A `public int BatteryCapacity` field.
   - A constructor that sets all the fields (using the base class constructor for the inherited fields).
   - A method `ShowElectricCar()` that prints the brand, year, model, and battery capacity.

4. **Test your classes** by running the following code:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle("Toyota", 2010, 12345);
        vehicle.ShowInfo();
        vehicle.Report();

        Car car = new Car("Honda", 2015, 23456, "Civic");
        car.ShowCar();
        car.Report(); // Calls Car.Report (hides Vehicle.Report)

        ElectricCar electric = new ElectricCar("Tesla", 2022, 34567, "Model S", 100);
        electric.ShowElectricCar();

    }
}
```
